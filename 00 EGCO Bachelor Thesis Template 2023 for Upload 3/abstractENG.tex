The paper describes an implemation of system to help in detection of motorbike, person using YOLO in combination with a custom model to detect head and helmet. In order to count these classes and document the class entering University gates through surveillance camera. The data is to be recorded throgh google sheet API, taking snapshot of a specific scenario where a civillians using motorbike are not wearing helmet. YOLOv8 is used as the main framework for it performances and continuous supports from developers as well as its accessibility. The custom model for helmet and head detection are trained, annotated through ROBOFLOW program, and the datasets are from the university's cctv camera. Five model has been trained and, one of the five has been choosesn for their perfromace to be implemented for the detections. The product is a system that detects motorbike, person, helmet and head. Using BotSort tracker in conjunction to aid in the counting algorithm. To evaluate the performance of our detection and counting system, we analyzed pre-recorded CCTV footage using various YOLO-based models. Detection accuracy was benchmarked against manual counts, with person and motorbike detections remaining consistently high due to the use of pretrained models. Helmet detection accuracy showed substantial improvement—from 42\% in the initial model to 96\% in the final version—by optimizing confidence thresholds. Counting performance was assessed using both a double-line method for helmet and head detection and the BoT-SORT tracker for motorbike and person tracking. While short line lengths (~150 pixels) minimized counting errors in the double-line method, some over- and undercounting still occurred due to overlapping objects or missed detections. BoT-SORT achieved relatively accurate results, though minor discrepancies were noted due to ID switches and tracking drift. Overall, the system demonstrated reliable detection and counting capabilities, with notable advancements in helmet detection accuracy through iterative model refinement.
