The paper describes an implemation of system to help in detection of motorbike, person using YOLO in combination with a custom model to detect head and helmet. In order to count these classes and document the class entering University gates through surveillance camera. The data is to be recorded throgh google sheet API, taking snapshot of a specific scenario where a civillians using motorbike are not wearing helmet. YOLOv8 is uses as the main framework for it performances and continuous supports from developers as well as its accessibility. The custom model for helmet and head detection are trained, annotated through ROBOFLOW program, and the datasets are from the university's cctv camera. Five model has been trained and, one of the five has been choosesn for their perfromace to be implemented for the detections. The product is a system that detects motorbike, person, helmet and head. Using BotSort tracker in conjunction to aid in the counting algorithm.
