\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\section{Background}
Urban traffic congestion and road safety, particularly for motorbikes, remain major issues. Motorcycles, due to their mobility, contribute greatly to traffic flow. However, they are also prone to violations, such as not wearing helmets or using the wrong lane, which increase the chance of an accident. Traditional traffic management systems lack the ability to detect and address such specific breaches in real time.

AI technologies, like as YOLO, a deep learning model for object detection, have showed potential in traffic surveillance but have not yet been routinely used to identify helmet use or lane breaches. Previous research has shown that YOLO is good for vehicle detection, but there is a gap in its use for targeted motorbike detection and safety compliance.

This research seeks to close this gap by utilising YOLO to detect motorcycles, check for helmet use, and identify lane violations. By focussing on these critical aspects, the system will improve road safety and aid in more effective traffic enforcement.

\section{Objective}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To detect motorbike, person, helmet and non-helmet user.
	\item Count motorbike, person, helmet and non-helmet users efficiently.
	\item Upload system up to university's server.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scope}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop system to detect motorbike, person, hemet and non-helmet user.
    \item Display annotated video.
    \item  Count all the essentails and display real time.
    \item University server running on system efficiently.
 

\end{enumerate}

\section{Expected Results}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To reduce illegal activities of riders.
	\item To ensure both safety of rider and pedestrian.
	\item To spraed safety awareness.
	\item Has more than 80 percent accuracy .
\end{enumerate}
